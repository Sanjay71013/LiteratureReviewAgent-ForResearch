## üß† Overview

This system integrates various autonomous agents to perform distinct research-related functions:

* **Literature Discovery Agent**: Searches and retrieves relevant academic papers from sources like arXiv.
* **Summarization Agent**: Generates concise summaries of academic papers.
* **Web Browsing Agent**: Navigates and extracts information from web sources.
* **Synthesis Agent**: Combines insights from multiple papers to provide comprehensive overviews.
* **Critique Agent**: Evaluates the quality and relevance of retrieved literature.

These agents collaborate using standardized communication protocols to ensure interoperability and scalability.

## üß© Architecture

The system employs a layered architecture:

* **Agent Layer**: Comprises specialized agents, each responsible for a specific task.
* **Communication Layer**: Facilitates interaction between agents using A2A for peer-to-peer communication and MCP for tool and data access.
* **Tool Integration Layer**: Connects agents to external tools and data sources via MCP, enabling access to APIs and databases.

This architecture promotes modularity, allowing for easy addition or modification of agents and tools.

## üîó Protocols

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP provides a standardized interface for agents to access external tools and data sources. It ensures secure and structured communication, facilitating tasks like data retrieval and processing.

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A)

A2A enables direct communication between agents, allowing them to delegate tasks and share information efficiently. This protocol supports dynamic collaboration and task management across heterogeneous agent systems.
